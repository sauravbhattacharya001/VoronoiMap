# VoronoiMap

This report explains a how some partially informed attacker can estimate aggregate statistics of an unknown set of objects embedded in the Euclidean plane using available partial data, a nearest-neighbor oracle. The algorithm presented employs Voronoi Partitioning of the set space, where each object contained in the set is associated with some geo-location parameters. Next, a real world usage of the algorithm EstimateSUM is illustrated along with corresponding performance metric results. Some alternatives have been suggested to make the work of the attacker difficult.
